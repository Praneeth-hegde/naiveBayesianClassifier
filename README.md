# Naive Bayes Classifier

This repository contains a Python program that implements the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm for classification tasks. It provides a simple and efficient way to train and evaluate the classifier using a sample training dataset stored as a .CSV file.

## Features

- Loads a training dataset from a .CSV file.
- Implements the Naive Bayes algorithm with Gaussian distribution for continuous features.
- Computes the accuracy of the classifier on test cases.
- Easy to use and extend for different datasets.
- Well-documented code with clear function definitions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/naive-bayes-classifier.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any).

3. Prepare your training dataset in .CSV format.

4. Edit the `main.py` file to specify the file path of your training dataset.

5. Run the program:

```
python main.py
```

The program will load the dataset, train the Naive Bayes classifier, and output the accuracy on a set of test cases.

## Sample Dataset

A sample training dataset, `sample.csv`, is provided in the repository for testing and experimentation. It includes a set of attributes and corresponding class labels.


## Contributing
